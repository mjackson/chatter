Strata is a streaming HTTP server for node.js that is patterned after
time-honored web server design principles pioneered in the Python and Ruby
communities, namely [WSGI](http://www.wsgi.org/) and
[Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/). Using Strata, developers can build highly
performant web servers in a powerful, modular style that is easy to maintain and
takes full advantage of the streaming capabilities and
excellent I/O handling of node.js.

The core Strata distribution consists of four things:

  - A specification (see SPEC) for building applications and middleware
  - A library (see lib) with many useful utilities and middleware to aid
    developers in the common tasks of building applications that conform to
    the specification
  - An executable (see bin/strata) for running Strata applications from the
    command line
  - A user manual (see doc) that contains detailed documentation and code
    examples

## Installation

Install Strata using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

    $ npm install strata

You are also free to [browse or download the source](https://github.com/mjijackson/strata).

## Usage

The simplest possible Strata app looks like this:

``` javascript
function app(env, callback) {
    callback(200, {}, "Hello world!");
}

require("strata").run(app);
```

## Documentation

The [Strata user manual](http://stratajs.org/manual) is designed to teach you
how to get up and running with the framework as quickly as possible. Each
chapter of the manual contains documentation about a certain feature of the
framework and a code example.

The manual is written in such a way that the topics and examples discussed in
higher numbered chapters build upon previous ones. Thus, it is recommended to
start with lower numbered chapters when getting started and work your way up to
higher ones.

The user manual refers to the [SPEC](https://raw.github.com/mjijackson/strata/master/SPEC)
in various places. This document is the canonical reference for the key building
blocks of the framework including applications, callbacks, and the Strata
environment.

## Tests

The test directory contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for all of
Strata's core modules. Use [vows](http://vowsjs.org) to run all tests:

    $ vows test/*_test.js

Run the tests for a specific module with:

    $ vows test/utils_test.js

## Acknowledgements

Strata was inspired by similar efforts in the Python and Ruby communities,
namely [WSGI](http://www.wsgi.org/) and [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/). It
borrows many code patterns from these libraries, as well as the [JSGI](http://jackjs.org/jsgi-spec.html)
project.

Strata's multipart parser is based on the fast parser in the node-formidable
project written by Felix Geisend√∂rfer. It is included in Strata under the terms
of the MIT license.

My sincere thanks to the authors of each of these libraries for the excellent
work they've done and graciously shared.

/**
 * A middleware that may be used to construct a middleware pipeline. It does
 * this by providing a useful `use` abstraction to allow users to declare the
 * middleware they want to use in the order they will be called in the request
 * cycle.
 *
 * Instances of this middleware also have all methods from the map and route
 * middlewares in order to simplify the number of steps needed to build an app
 * complete with a middleware pipeline, URL prefix mapping, and routing.
 *
 * Furthermore, calling any build method on the strata module itself will
 * automatically create an instance of this middleware, as in the following
 * example.
 *
 *   var strata = require("strata");
 *
 *   strata.use(strata.contentLength);
 *   strata.use(strata.contentType, "text/html");
 *   strata.use(strata.sessionCookie);
 *
 *   strata.map("/images", function (app) {
 *       // This app is called for all requests starting with "/images". Let's
 *       // try to serve them out of /path/to/images using a strata.file.
 *       app.use(strata.file, "/path/to/images");
 *   });
 *
 *   strata.get("/", function (env, callback) {
 *       // This is called on GET /
 *   });
 *
 *   strata.run(function (env, callback) {
 *       // This function is called when no mappings/routes match.
 *       callback(200, {}, "Hello world!");
 *   });
